Design Document: Workflow Assembly Frontend Library

1. Overview

This document describes a frontend library that allows users—both technical and non-technical—to assemble customized “workflow” software on the web. The library will offer both code-based and code-free (low-code/no-code) pathways. It aims to integrate with common JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue), with initial development focusing on React.

2. Context

Problem Statement
	•	Many organizations need custom workflow tools to manage processes, approvals, data transformations, and user interactions.
	•	Traditional development approaches require significant coding effort for each unique workflow.
	•	Non-technical users often rely on specialized, expensive software solutions that do not easily integrate into modern web frameworks.

Challenges
	•	Broad User Base: Enabling both developers and non-developers to design workflows.
	•	Flexible Data Model: Accommodating varied workflow requirements without overcomplication.
	•	Modular Architecture: Embeddable in existing apps or used standalone.
	•	Code-Free Interface: Providing drag-and-drop/WYSIWYG while maintaining robustness.

Proposed Solution
	•	A frontend library that includes:
	1.	A Workflow Builder (visual interface for non-technical users).
	2.	A Core Engine (abstraction of tasks, steps, transitions, data flow).
	3.	Connectors (for integration with external systems, third-party APIs, or backend endpoints).

3. Goals and Non-Goals

Goals
	1.	Reusability: Provide pluggable UI components and a flexible data model for reuse across projects.
	2.	Extensibility: Support common frameworks; allow custom logic through well-defined extension points.
	3.	Code-Free / Low-Code Capabilities: Offer a drag-and-drop builder and minimal training needed.
	4.	API-Driven: Expose a robust API for custom data, event handling, or real-time updates.
	5.	Modular Architecture: Enable individual upgrades or replacements of components.

Non-Goals
	1.	Backend Implementation: Focus on frontend; server/database logic is out of scope.
	2.	Full-fledged DevOps: Provide guidelines but not complete infrastructure or CI/CD solutions.
	3.	Advanced Analytics: Basic tracking only; complex analytics should be handled separately.
	4.	Full BPM Replacement: Intended to solve common workflow needs, not replace heavyweight BPM systems.

Components Explanation
	1.	Core Workflow Engine
	•	State Management: Central store (Redux, MobX, or custom) tracking workflow state, transitions, and data.
	•	Task/Step Orchestration: Logic defining step execution order, triggers, transitions, concurrency handling.
	•	Event Handling: Publish-subscribe mechanism for internal or external event communication.
	2.	UI Components
	•	Drag-and-Drop Builder: Visual canvas for placing and linking workflow steps.
	•	Form Builders, Step Config: Configurable forms and settings for each step.
	•	Visual Connectors / Lines: Graphical representation (e.g., SVG, Canvas) of step relationships.
	3.	Connectors / Integrations
	•	REST/GraphQL APIs: Wrappers for external data retrieval or submission.
	•	Webhooks: Real-time triggers for asynchronous workflow events.
	•	Custom Adapters: Extendable interface for proprietary systems.
	4.	Code-Free / Low-Code Interface
	•	Drag-and-Drop UI: WYSIWYG builder for non-developers.
	•	Config-Based DSL: JSON/YAML schema describing steps, transitions, data flow.
	•	Workflow Templates: Pre-built patterns (e.g., approvals, data enrichment).

5. Tool Breakdown and Implementation Details

5.1 Core Workflow Engine

Goal: Handle creation, modification, and execution of workflows.

Implementation Outline:
	1.	Workflow Data Model
	•	Workflow object containing a list of Steps.
	•	Each Step has input/output definitions, transitions, validation rules.
	2.	Execution Manager
	•	Traverses the workflow, triggers steps, monitors completion.
	•	May allow pausing/resuming workflows.
	3.	Event Bus
	•	Publish-subscribe mechanism (EventEmitter, RxJS, etc.) for inter-component communication.

Key Considerations:
	•	Custom logic injection at each step.
	•	Handling parallel/concurrent steps.
	•	Error handling and resilience.

5.2 UI Components

Goal: Provide reusable components that can be embedded in various applications.

Implementation Outline:
	1.	Drag-and-Drop Canvas
	•	Built on tools like react-flow, dnd-kit, or react-beautiful-dnd.
	2.	Step Configuration Panels
	•	Modals or forms for step properties.
	•	Validation, advanced input controls.
	3.	Connector Visualization
	•	Lines/curves that dynamically update when steps are moved.
	4.	Theming
	•	Theming system (styled-components, CSS modules) for look-and-feel consistency.

Key Considerations:
	•	Accessibility and responsive design.
	•	Abstraction for Angular/Vue support.
	•	Extensibility for custom UI requirements.

5.3 Connectors / Integrations

Goal: Manage data exchange with external systems.

Implementation Outline:
	1.	REST/GraphQL Clients
	•	Wrappers using fetch, axios, or Apollo for network calls.
	2.	Webhook Handlers
	•	Code-based registration of webhooks or wizards for code-free setup.
	3.	Custom Adapters
	•	Clearly defined interface for building new connectors for proprietary services.

Key Considerations:
	•	Security (authentication, authorization).
	•	Retry strategies, rate limiting, error handling.

5.4 Code-Free / Low-Code Interface

Goal: Facilitate workflow building for non-developers.

Implementation Outline:
	1.	WYSIWYG Editor
	•	Drag-and-drop blocks representing tasks.
	•	Tooltips or tutorials for new users.
	2.	Configuration DSL
	•	JSON/YAML-based schema auto-generated from the UI.
	•	Editable by advanced users for fine-grained control.
	3.	Template Library
	•	Common workflow patterns (approvals, data pipelines).
	•	Import/export functionality to share templates.

Key Considerations:
	•	Validation to avoid broken workflows.
	•	Guided mode or tutorials.

6. Conclusion and Next Steps

By combining the Core Workflow Engine, UI Components, Connectors, and a Code-Free/Low-Code Interface, this frontend library empowers both developers and non-technical users to build custom workflows quickly.

Immediate Next Steps
	1.	Technical Prototype: Create a minimal example (React-based drag-and-drop canvas + basic state management).
	2.	Feedback & Iteration: Gather early feedback to refine usability and fill feature gaps.
	3.	Framework Abstractions: Gradually decouple React-specific portions for Angular/Vue support.
